# 🚀 Tabadul Application

**Tabadul** is an innovative mobile application designed to simplify the process of buying and selling used items and offering services within the local community. Unlike random posts on social media, Tabadul provides a more organized and trustworthy environment for exchanging goods and services.

The app allows users to list used items for sale across different categories, while buyers can browse, reserve, and contact sellers directly to complete the deal — with delivery right to their doorstep.

In addition to product exchange, **Tabadul** also serves as a platform for service providers such as electricians, plumbers, carpenters, and more. These professionals can create personal profiles, describe their services, and make it easy for users to reach them via mobile phone.
